# GradeTool

This application takes numeric grades as inputs and produces the
corresponding letter grades following 
[the triage grading policy](https://www.cs.bsu.edu/~pvgestwicki/misc/grading.shtml).

This project is provided as an example for students to refactor. It
intentionally violates many principles of good programming practice.
